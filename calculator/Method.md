1. Declared and initialized calculator and key as global constants, for ease of implementation.

2. In the first codeblock, I used addEventListener to keys so that whenever they are clicked, the code within is implemented. The reason that I split up the first 2 code blocks is for one to log the keys whilst the second is for altering the display.

3. I assigned the 'data-action' properties to the buttopns which were not numbers; the +, -, multiply (which I found out is represented by &times;), รท, =, C and  the decimal (.) keys.
